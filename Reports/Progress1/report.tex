\item[What learning algorithms have you tried? Reflect upon the performance.] So far in the competition we have primarily tried implimenting three methods:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{colmeans}
  \item \textbf{vw}
  \item \textbf{soft impute}
  \end{itemize}

\item[Actual performance of algorithms. Which ones worked well? Which performed poorly? Why?]

\item[Project organization.] In order to deal with the inevitable technical problems of colobration, our team has setup a github repository to share code and results. We've also both setup DAVinCI accounts and succesfully ran jobs on the cluster. Looking forward, we are in the process of creating a shared folder on DAVinCI and plan on utalizing the cluster for future computations.

\item[Have you innovated? If so, how?]

\item[What are the future direction in which you would like to go?]
